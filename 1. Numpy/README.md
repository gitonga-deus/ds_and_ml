### NumPy also has its own builtin generation methods of creating arrays

np.arange - it works as python range function. It takes three arguments the start, stop and the step size.

np.zeros - generates an array of all zeros.

np.ones - generates an array of all ones.

np.linspace - returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. linspace takes a third argument as the number of points you want.

np.eye - this is an identity matrix.

np.random.rand - this is going to populate an array of the given shape you pass in and it's going to populate it with random samples from a uniform distribution over 0 to 1.

np.random.randn - returns random numbers from a standard normal distribution centered around 0.

np.random.randint - returns random integers from a low to a high number and also a size
